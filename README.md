# Vizality

Vizality is a @discordapp client modification based on [Bandaged BetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp) by [rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi), which is a fork of the original [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp) by [Jiiks](https://github.com/Jiiks). It has the good features seen on its predecessors, such as plugins (now called 'extensions'), themes, and custom CSS, as well as some cool new features and a more organized and easily understood API.

This version has been tailored to my ideals and what I think makes a better modding experience for the typical user. The idea revolves around providing a built-in theme editor for users who don't have much knowledge of CSS, or simply want to customize things easier and more quickly. This will be done by creating a Sass framework based around CSS custom properties.
